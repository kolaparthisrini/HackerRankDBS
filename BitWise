Bitwise XOR
XOR(^) is a binary operation called exclusive OR and works as

1^0 = 1  
0^1 = 1  
0^0 = 0
1^1 = 0  
XOR by 1 can work like a toggle switch that turns 1 to 0 or 0 to 1.

Another interesting thing to note is

x^0 = x 
x^x = 0

===>XOR in Depth
---------------------
Look at the truth table of XOR:
0 ^ 0 = 0
0 ^ 1 = 1
1 ^ 0 = 1
1 ^ 1 = 0
Now look at the truth table of addition in binary:
0 + 0 = 0 (carry 0)
0 + 1 = 1 (carry 0)
1 + 0 = 1 (carry 0)
1 + 1 = 0 WITH CARRY 1 (=10)
This means the addition between two digits in binary is the XOR of the two bits, and the carry is the AND of the bits.
If you look for two operands A, B where A ^ B = A + B, you need that you never have a carry when summing them. 
This happens if it NEVER happens that the i-th bit of A and the i-th bit of B are both 1. So given the operand A,
all the bits in A which are 1 must be 0 in B. They are fixed bits and you have no choice for them. But all other bits in B 
are free and you can set them to 1 or 0 and the equation will keep being true. To count all possible values of B, you must then
count the 0's in A (i.e. the number of free bits in B) and calculate 2 to the power of the free bits.
